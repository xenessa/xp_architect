PHASE 3 SUMMARY: Validation & Clarification
============================================================

# Validation Phase - Key Clarifications

Here are the critical highlights from our validation conversation - anything missing or wrong?

**Lead Flow & Qualification Strategy**
- Hybrid model bridges current spreadsheet approach with future scalability: standard leads enter holding area for qualification before converting to opportunities (filtering out high unqualified volume), while white glove leads auto-convert and route to team leads—solving both pipeline inflation and premium deal visibility challenges

**Approval Workflow Complexity**
- Four-tier discount approval structure (10%/20%/25%/25%+) with variable urgency creates coordination challenge that's currently managed through informal follow-up; white glove 2-hour SLA and high-probability same-day needs require formal notification/escalation to prevent lost deals

**Quote-to-Cash Process Gaps**
- Current manual quote versioning in Word lacks change tracking needed for pattern analysis; pricing must lock at quote creation (not pull current rates) to honor commitments when quarterly updates happen mid-deal; booking number currently manual lookup/increment creates risk of duplicates when multiple deals close simultaneously

**Team Performance Visibility**
- Coaching effectiveness hinges on surfacing deal quality patterns beyond volume metrics: upsell/cross-sell behavior (are reps maximizing value through add-ons or taking easy base package sales), deal mix analysis (substantial strategic deals vs quick low-value transactions), and activity-to-outcome correlation across the rep → team lead → director → VP hierarchy

**Integration Ecosystem Dependencies**
- Marketing Cloud connection in-progress must complete before sales launch to enable campaign attribution and automate post-booking survey (currently daily spreadsheet monitoring); third-party booking department handoff needs customer info + package details + auto-generated booking number; Customer Support email notifications bridge to phase 2 onboarding

**Data Migration Reality Check**
- Three years of historical wins/losses have inconsistent quality due to variable rep logging habits; migration strategy balances historical context value against clean-start benefits by filtering for minimum actionable data (customer name + contact method) while accepting incomplete records that meet threshold

**Adoption & Change Management**
- First-time CRM users need friction-reducing design over enforcement: manual email logging with one-click Outlook integration (rep controls business-relevant capture), vacation status auto-pausing lead assignment with team visibility for coverage, gentle encouragement of activity tracking before layering mandatory fields as value becomes apparent

**AI Capability Expectations**
- Leadership purchased Einstein licenses expecting early AI value, not phased approach; plan deploys rule-based lead scoring immediately (responsive + budget + dates logic team already trusts) while activating Einstein pattern analysis once data flows—managing stakeholder expectations while ensuring adoption success
