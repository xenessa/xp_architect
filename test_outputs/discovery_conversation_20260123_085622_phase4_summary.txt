PHASE 4 SUMMARY: Future State & Priorities
============================================================

# Future State & Priorities - Key Highlights

Here are the highlights from our discussion about success criteria - anything missing or wrong?

**The Real Business Case: Expansion, Not Just System Replacement**
- Salesforce isn't about fixing spreadsheet chaos—it's about unlocking geographic expansion beyond Greece that's currently impossible without operational infrastructure that can scale; the company has delayed growth because "we can barely keep track of Greece"

**Success Hierarchy Reveals What Actually Matters**
- Priority 1: Real-time pipeline visibility + quarterly forecast accuracy jumping from 50-60% to 80-90% (the confidence gap is killing decision-making)
- Priority 2: Effortless performance tracking without pivot table gymnastics (win/loss, deal size, cycle length, stage conversions, activity volume)
- Priority 3: Regional leaderboards with quality-adjusted rankings (deal complexity + upsell behavior, not just volume) driving healthy competition
- Priority 4: 360° customer view enabling personalized service and retention foundation for future cross-sell when new countries launch

**Day-One Non-Negotiables vs. Phased Rollout**
- Critical workflows must be bulletproof at launch: discount approvals (4-tier with urgency), quote versioning with change tracking, lead scoring (rule-based + Einstein); willing to tolerate manual reporting temporarily because "I can't trust the reporting until the core is solid"—smart sequencing that prioritizes data quality over dashboards

**The Adoption Challenge That Could Derail Everything**
- Biggest fear is user adoption failure with technology-hesitant sales team (first-time CRM users who "don't know much about technology other than social media and Google search"); 30-day hard cutover is non-negotiable but needs mitigation: role-appropriate simplified views, progressive feature disclosure, clear visual guidance, robust support (training + peer champions + office hours during week 1-2)

**Future Integration Vision Completes the Loop**
- Long-term goal to integrate directly with booking vendor (currently 3rd party email handoff) to close full customer lifecycle and enable upsell/cross-sell opportunities—Salesforce is Phase 1 of larger ecosystem transformation

**90-Day Success Marker Sets Clear Accountability**
- Forecast accuracy at 80-90% with full pipeline confidence + 100% team transition from spreadsheets = measurable win that validates investment and enables leadership to plan strategically rather than react to yesterday's stale data
